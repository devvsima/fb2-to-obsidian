# FB2 to Obsidian Markdown Converter (Booker)

ðŸ“š A simple script to convert `.fb2` books into folders of Markdown files optimized for reading in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).
Each page of the book is saved as a separate `.md` file with built-in **next/previous** navigation.

---

## ðŸ¤” Why?

I spent a long time searching for a comfortable book reader with sync between devices â€” but found nothing that fully suited me.
Thatâ€™s when the idea came: create a script that transforms `.fb2` books into a structure that Obsidian can work with.

Now I can read books **directly inside Obsidian**, with smooth page-by-page navigation and full control.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Automatically scans for all `.fb2` files in the current folder
- Extracts book title and author from metadata
- Creates a separate folder for each book
- Splits the content into fixed-length pages
- Generates Markdown files with forward/backward navigation links
